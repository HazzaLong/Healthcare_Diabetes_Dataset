    Welcome to my healthcare project!

What's the story I hear you ask? Let me walk you through!
**Also, please see screenshots folder within the repository**

## Number 1: Pick a dataset
With many platforms to pick studies/datasets from, I chose 'Kaggle'. A good friend of mine with a talent for data recommended it to me, and it's a fascinating platform.

I chose healthcare since having shadowed/worked alongside my mentor on a New York, USA based healthcare courier company in early 2022, which was fascinating. Diabetes is the topic as I was curious to see what the data showed, being that some personal family members suffer from this.

I chose a dataset provided on Kaggle by Nandita Pore. Then downloaded the .csv file containing all relevant quantitative and qualitative data.

## Number 2: Setting Up the Project
### Installation and Setup
- **Python Packages:**
  - Utilizing Python, I installed essential packages such as SQLAlchemy, pandas, and seaborn for data analysis.

- **IDE:**
  - My weapon of choice was PyCharm, providing a smooth development experience.

### Project Structure
- **Directory Structure:**
  - The project's directory, named 'Healthcare_Diabetes_Dataset', houses all the necessary files and folders.

- **File Placement:**
  - The dataset file, 'Healthcare-Diabetes.csv', was initially located on the Desktop, and I managed file paths accordingly in the Python script.

## Number 3: Database Setup
### MySQL Setup
- **VsCode and Terminal Interaction:**
  - Leveraging VsCode and the Mac's terminal, I initiated the setup of a MySQL database and table.

- **User Management:**
  - Through the terminal, I created additional users, set permissions, and regulated user accessibility to ensure robust security measures.

## Number 4: Python Script
### Script Purpose
- **Populating the Database:**
  - The Python script serves the purpose of reading data from the CSV file and populating the MySQL table named 'DiabetesData'.

### Project Testing
- **Interactive Testing:**
  - For interactive testing, I used VsCode and the terminal to ensure seamless communication between Python and MySQL.

## Number 5: Conclusion
### Challenges and Solutions
- **Overcoming Challenges:**
  - Throughout the project, I encountered challenges related to package versions, but I persevered by utilizing the terminal for updates and resolutions.

### Learnings
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - The project enhanced my understanding of data analysis, database management, and the seamless integration of Python and MySQL.

## Number 6: Additional Notes or Footnotes
- **Impressive Achievements:**
  - Successfully implemented a robust system for managing MySQL databases and tables.
  - Demonstrated effective user management through the terminal for enhanced security.
